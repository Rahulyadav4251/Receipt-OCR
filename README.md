# Receipt OCR 🧾🔍  

This project focuses on extracting text from **Unimarkt company receipts** using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**. It involves three main stages:  

1. **Preprocessing** - Enhancing the receipt image to focus on product details.  
2. **OCR Processing** - Detecting and merging text boxes for accurate extraction.  
3. **Post-Processing** - Structuring extracted text specifically for Unimarkt receipts.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses **PaddleOCR** for accurate text extraction.  
- **OpenCV** for image enhancement.  
- **Regular Expressions & Pandas** for text processing.  
- Supports structured receipt data extraction.
